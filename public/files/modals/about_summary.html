  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I spent years in operations — managing teams, running day-to-day, making calls under pressure with
    whatever information was available. That was usually not enough. Reports came late, metrics were
    inconsistent, and the data that existed was rarely in a shape you could actually act on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I kept hitting the same wall: the answers were somewhere in the data, but getting to them required
    either waiting on someone else or accepting the guess. I stopped accepting the guess.
  </p>
  <p>
    I taught myself the tools — SQL, Python, dbt, BigQuery, the works — and started building the
    systems I wished had existed. What started as a frustration became a practice, and that practice
    became this portfolio.
  </p>

  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <p>
    I start from the business question, not the dataset. Most data problems aren't really data problems
    — they're clarity problems. Once the question is sharp, the rest is engineering: clean pipelines,
    validated transforms, and outputs that tell a story a decision-maker can actually use.
  </p>
  <p>
    I care about the whole system. Not just the query that works today, but the pipeline that holds up
    at 3am when something upstream changes. Automated tests. Documented transforms. Stakeholder-ready
    outputs that don't require a translator.
  </p>
  <p>
    And increasingly, I care about what comes next — AI-powered automation, agentic systems, and the
    layer of intelligence that turns good data infrastructure into something that actually acts on
    what it finds.
  </p>

  <h2>What I'm Building Toward</h2>
  <p>
    I'm building a freelance analytics practice while pursuing full-time <strong>data analyst</strong>
    and <strong>analytics engineer</strong> roles. Whether I'm joining a team or partnering with a
    business, I bring the same thing: operational judgment, technical rigor, and a genuine interest
    in making the data actually useful — not just present.
  </p>
  <p>
    The projects in this portfolio aren't demos for their own sake. They're the systems I built to
    learn by doing, and they reflect how I'd approach real problems.
